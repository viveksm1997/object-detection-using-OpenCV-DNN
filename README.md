# object-detection-using-OpenCV-DNN

The OpenCV DNN module  supports deep learning inference on images and videos.

Using the OpenCV DNN module, we can easily get started with Object Detection in deep learning and computer vision.

In this project MobileNet-SSD (Single Shot Detector), which has been pre-trained on the MS COCO dataset has been used.

SSD models are generally faster when compared to other object detection models. 
Moreover, the MobileNet backbone also makes them less compute-intensive.

This model is also implemented "embedded devices(raspberry pi, USB camera) " to perform real time object detection.

All supporting files and the code is attached in the files above.
